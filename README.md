# Abyss Linux
Abyss is a Void based linux distro that aims to make the power of Void accessible to your average beta ubuntu user. 

Abyss is very early on in development but will continue to be built with a few key ideas in mind:

#### 1. Accessibility
Abyss linux is made as a sort of parallel to Manjaro or Ubuntu. Where Manjaro and Ubuntu each respectively improved on their origin distros (Arch and Debian) to make them easy to use for a wider audience, Abyss will do the same for Void
#### 2. Honestly
Basically I'm not gonna just add a bunch of crucial stuff and not tell anyone, if I deem a change big it'll be announced
#### 3. Informality
I'm just some random ass unqualified dude who's messing around with an underated distro (I'm talking about Void here not Abyss) so I'm gonna treat it as such. Basically I'm not gonna take this whole thing too seriously.

## Installation

Currently only WSL is supported, this is because Abyss is very early on in development and it is most convenient to me right now. To install simply download the latest release, unzip it and run the Abyss.exe file to install it

## Why Void?
Originally I was gonna go with Debian as it was the first linux distro I ever used and it holds a special place in my heart but after a lot of consideration I realized that Abyss would be almost instantly lost to the sea of other Ubuntu clones. So instead of going with Debian or Arch or something else thats over-saturated with children distros I wanted to go with a less saturated distribution. Void was the obvious choice for me here, due to its decently lightweight status, large amount of supported hardware and mid levels of popularity I thought it the best option.

## What's Next?
Alot.<br>
Right now Abyss is just Void with a fancy hat on, there is pretty much no difference. <br>
In the future here are some key things i'd like to implement from soonest to latest (keep in mind these are very subject to change):<br>
- Some images (ISO and IMG), just waiting to fully plan out the scope and mission for Abyss
- KDE5 (plasma) out of the box
- The basic applications everyone needs, E.G mp3 and mp4 player, a decent web browser, that sorta stuff
- Wider support for alternative package managers, XBPS is cool and all put I like snapd and stuff
- Absorb some of the better aspects from windows, E.G
- A mobile version for the pine phone or something
<br>
It is also to note that if I get bored of this project and it doesnt have many eyes on it then Abyss will be abandoned. If I get bored of this project and it **does** have some supporters than it'll be handed over to someone else.
